Each contest - there are approximately 1500 - 2000 users who participate for the 1st time and get rated.The Chef wanted to tell new users some tricks for their 1st contest:
Before the contest - you don’t have any rating. So even if you make a single submission - you will become part of the contest rank list and you will get a rating.
If you want your rating to increase - give the entire 2 hours to the contest & don’t quit! If you keep trying till the end, and the more time you get, the more problems you can solve. 
That means larger rating increases!
Do not ask your friends for their code. 
If you copy paste their code, you will get caught during plagiarism checks and your rating will be reduced by 275 points, along with a permanent black mark on your profile.
